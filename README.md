This course was my first true dive into report building and the various applicatoins and tools that can assist in making them. Course competencies for this class include: Explain the historical, present, and future practices of data presentation and reporting, utilize the Microsoft SQL Server database and SQL Server Management Stuio software to access data for data presentation, Interact with open database connectivity, ODBC, and ODBC compliant software to connect data management software to a database, Connect to databases via a data source in a data reporting software, Create database queries utilizing SQL to produce datasets used by reporting software, and Use parameters, functions, claculated fields, charts, and images in a report. All of these competencies were then put into practice to design and create detailed reports that summarized data based on scenarios that were given. The attached files contain the Final Reports that were created for this course which demonstrate all the listed competencies. (the report will not actually run as the data has been lost but the design can still be seen)
